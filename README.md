## :1234: About it
This is a site that receive CSV files and return a set of statistics of them.
After uploading the archives you get a default table grouped by the first column of the CSV, you can also reorganize it by clicking on the buttons of the column's names.
At the end of the table there are buttons that show you some charts of the columns, they have the amount of each thing in the column, so you can see clearly which ones apper more than others.

## :arrow_forward: Input
The input are some compatible CSV files.
With compatible, I mean, they have to have the same columns and have to have equal number of columns. If they don't have it, the site will show an error alert. This alert appears also when you put archives that aren't CSV files.

The site organize compatible data, be aware of this.

## :arrow_backward: Ouput
The ouput will be a table that can be reorganized and show you a different table grouped by column.
And, there are charts of the columns at the output.

If the CSV is very extensive, one or some charts can become a bit small and the table can become huge.

The number that the things appeared are between parentheses.

**Obs.: You can also download the statistics by saving a pdf of the page(by clicking ctrl+p or just trying to print the page), but for some reason the colors change when you try to do it**
